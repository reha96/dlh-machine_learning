    network.

    Args:
        dZ (numpy.ndarray): of shape (m, h_new, w_new, c_new) containing
            the partial derivatives with respect to the unactivated output
            of the convolutional layer.
            - m is the number of examples
            - h_new is the height of the output
            - w_new is the width of the output
            - c_new is the number of channels in the output
        A_prev (numpy.ndarray): of shape (m, h_prev, w_prev, c_prev)
            containing the output of the previous layer.
            - h_prev is the height of the previous layer
            - w_prev is the width of the previous layer
            - c_prev is the number of channels in the previous layer
        W (numpy.ndarray): of shape (kh, kw, c_prev, c_new) containing the
            kernels for the convolution.
            - kh is the filter height
            - kw is the filter width
        b (numpy.ndarray): of shape (1, 1, 1, c_new) containing the biases
            applied to the convolution.
        padding (str): either 'same' or 'valid', indicating the type of
            padding used.
        stride (tuple): (sh, sw) containing the strides for the convolution.
            - sh is the stride for the height
            - sw is the stride for the width

    Returns:
        numpy.ndarray, numpy.ndarray, numpy.ndarray: the partial derivatives
        with respect to the previous layer (dA_prev), the kernels (dW), and
        the biases (db), respectively.
