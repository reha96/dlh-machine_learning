"""
Based on 3-posterior.py, write a function
def posterior(x, n, p1, p2): that
calculates the posterior probability that the probability
of developing severe side effects falls within a specific
range given the data:

x is the number of patients that develop severe side effects
n is the total number of patients observed
p1 is the lower bound on the range
p2 is the upper bound on the range
You can assume the prior beliefs of p follow a uniform
distribution
If n is not a positive integer, raise a ValueError
with the message n must be a positive integer
If x is not an integer that is greater than or equal
to 0, raise a ValueError with the message x must be an integer
that is greater than or equal to 0
If x is greater than n, raise a ValueError with the message
x cannot be greater than n
If p1 or p2 are not floats within the range [0, 1], raise a ValueError
with the message {p} must be a float in the range [0, 1] where {p}
is the corresponding variable
if p2 <= p1, raise a ValueError with the message p2 must
be greater than p1
The only import you are allowed to use is from
scipy import special
Returns: the posterior probability that p is within
the range [p1, p2] given x and n
